This article explains how this website was built from scratch. I chose the [Docusaurus TypeScript variant](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support#initialization) based on the project's scope.

## Initialization
Docusaurus requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) version 18 or up. I use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) as the package manager. 

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest website classic --typescript
```


```bash npm2yarn
npm run start
```

## Using `Yarn`

:::security[important]
Installing Yarn globally is **NOT** recommended.
:::


Instead, we can use [Corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack), which enables us to define our preferred package manager and its version in the `package.json` file.

```bash
corepack enable
```

```bash
yarn set version stable
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn start
```


## Run locally


```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

Alternatively, you can also run the following:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run build && npm run serve
```




## Troubleshooting
Issues can happen especially during upgrades in the core `packages`. If you ran into one, follow these steps:


1. Clear website caches:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run clear
```

2. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, or `yarn.lock`,

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock package-lock.json
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pwsh" label="PowerShell">

  ```sh
  @('node_modules','yarn.lock','package-lock.json') | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Reinstall packages:


<details>
<summary>For Yarn</summary>

Skip this if you're not using `yarn`.


<Tabs groupId="shell">
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  
  ```bash
ni yarn.lock
```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cmd" label="CMD">
  
  ```bash
  echo. > yarn.lock
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pwsh" label="PowerShell">
  
  ```bash
  New-Item yarn.lock -ItemType File
```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>


```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```
