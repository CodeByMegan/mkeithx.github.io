## Bugs 🐛
Before submitting, please make sure that you run through the ff:

### Self-Assess ✅
Take a moment to consider the following questions:

- 🗸 Do I have a clear idea of where the issue is occurring?
- 🗸 Have I provided clear steps to reproduce the problem?
- 🗸 Could this issue be a result of my own mistakes?
- 🗸 Has this bug been [reported previously](https://github.com/mkeithX/mkeithx.github.io/issues)?

### Run Tests ✅
Typically, problems can occur when the application is not [configured correctly](/community/issue/installation#initialization). You can also try our basic troubleshooting steps outlined in [this article](/community/issue/installation#troubleshooting).

### Pre-flight ✅

When reporting a bug, it’s helpful to provide the following information:

- **Description:** A clear and concise explanation of the problem.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** A step-by-step guide on how to replicate the issue.

## Docs📒

**Documentation-related issues** focus on improving the clarity, accuracy, or completeness of project documentation. Good documentation is essential for helping users understand how to use the software, navigate its features, and contribute effectively. It’s often one of the most neglected aspects of software development, yet it plays a vital role in the overall success of a project.

Common types of documentation issues include:

- **Inaccuracies:** Incorrect information that needs to be updated.
- **Clarity:** Sections that are confusing or difficult to understand.
- **Missing Information:** Important details that are not covered in the documentation.
- **Outdated Content:** Information that is no longer relevant due to updates in the software.

When creating a documentation issue, be sure to include specific examples of the problem and suggest possible improvements. This proactive approach can lead to more effective documentation and a better user experience.

## Feature Requests❓
You can use the [feedback board](/feature-requests) to submit casual feature requests if you're not ready to open a pull request. It’s a simple way to share your ideas and get community feedback.

- **Title:** A clear and descriptive title for the request.
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of the proposed feature and its benefits.

We prioritize developing features based on votes and trending suggestions, so your input matters!

## Proposals💡

If you intend to make any **non-trivial changes** to existing implementations,  we kindly ask you to start by discussing the change you wish to make. This allows us to have an open dialogue about your proposed changes, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and understands the context and goals behind the modification.
