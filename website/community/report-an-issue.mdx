Streamline guides for squashing bugs and sharing ideas.

## Bugs
Please take note that the project is built and aligns with the latest Docusaurus version and it is very important to review these items before submitting an issue to ensure youâ€™ve completed the necessary steps:

### Basic Troubleshooting

#### 1st step

```bash npm2yarn
npm run clear
```
#### 2nd step

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock package-lock.json
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pwsh" label="PowerShell">

  ```sh
  @('node_modules','yarn.lock','package-lock.json') | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3rd step

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

#### Self Assess

Consider ask yourself the following:
- Do I have an idea of where the issue occurs?
- Did I include clear steps to reproduce it?
- Could it be due to my own mistakes?
- Has this bug already been reported?

Once you are certain that it is indeed **bug**, feel free to [submit a report](https://github.com/mkeithX/mkeithx.github.io/issues/new/choose).
