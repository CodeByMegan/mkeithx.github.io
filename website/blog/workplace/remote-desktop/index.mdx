## Cloud vs Remote {#cloud-vs-remote}
<!-- > How are they different? -->

- **Cloud PC** is a virtual machine providing users with a rich Windows Desktop experience hosted in the Windows365 services.
- **Remote Desktop** is a tool for accessing your Cloud PC from anywhere using another device.

## How to Access

Visit [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com) to see remote desktop that your admin has made available to you. If you get an error similar to "subscription and/or license", reach out your manager to ask and confirm whether your employment package comes with the **Cloud PC license**.

:::tip[keep in mind]

**Admins don't manually create Cloud PCs**. Cloud PCs are created automatically by the Windows 365 service when an appropriate license is assigned.

## How to Install

Login to [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com) > Navigate to Downloads > Choose the system type (64/32) in the dropdown. If you don't know what your system type, click to "what's my os" button bellow.
