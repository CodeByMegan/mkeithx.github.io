Today, I want to honor a special dog owned by someone very dear to me. Though I never had the pleasure of meeting this canine friend named Shiloh, I've been touched by countless stories of her playful and loving nature.

Though she may have crossed the rainbow bridge, her memory lives on in the hearts of those who knew and loved her. Today, I honor her legacy and the special bond shared with her human companions.


Farewell, dear Shiloh. You may have only been a part of our lives for a short time, but your paw prints will forever be etched in our hearts.
