After some time off, I'm happy to introduce the django-crud-demo project -  A simple yet effective way to explore CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Django. Designed to help developers understand the frameworkâ€™s core concepts, this project offers a hands-on approach to building web applications.
