## Cloud vs Remote {#cloud-vs-remote}
<!-- > How are they different? -->

- **Cloud PC** is a virtual machine providing users with a rich Windows Desktop experience hosted in the Windows365 services.
- **Remote Desktop** is a tool for accessing your Cloud PC from anywhere using another device.

## Where will I get it?

Visit [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com) to see remote desktop that your admin has made available to you.

## I was ABLE to login but: 

- I get an error that says:

- I get a blank page after clearing cache, history and cookies

Get in touch with your manager to ask and confirm whether your employment package comes with the Cloud PC license.

## Installation
Once your device meets the minimum hardware requirements, download the Remote Desktop client:

- Login to [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com) > Navigate to Downloads > Choose the system type in the dropdown.
- To get the System Type of your device: 
Go > Settings > System > About.
