## GitHub Projects
> Manage everything from issues to pull requests.

One of the steps I’ve taken recently is integrating GitHub into my project. This has completely transformed how I manage everything from issues to pull requests.

### What's in it
- **Streamlined Workflow**: I can now sync issues, pull requests, and commits directly with my dashboard, making tracking progress so much easier!

- **Automated Actions**: I’ve set up specific triggers for GitHub events, allowing me to automate parts of my workflow and focus on development.

This integration has simplified the development process and made it a lot more enjoyable!

## Reviving Django
> Getting back to the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

After taking some time off, I felt it was the perfect moment to dive back into Django and do some refresh. As a start, I come with a mini project `django-custom-user`. This project serves as a simple yet effective way to explore the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Django. 


### Features

- **Custom User Model** : Extend the default user model using AbstractUser to add fields like bio or profile picture while retaining authentication features.
- **PostgreSQL** : Use PostgreSQL as the database backend.
- **More** : Custom features such as creating dummy users, age restriction ect..

### Quick Start

Clone to it in your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkeithX/django-crud-demo.git
```
Visit [the repo](https://github.com/mkeithX/django-crud-demo) to know more.

## Enhancements

- **Feature Request** : I’ve also streamlined the process especially for those who are not ready to open a pull request.
- **Action Workflows** : Bumped action workflows to automate key processes.
- **Cloudflare Deployment** : Integrated GitHub actions via Cloudflare, adding an extra layer of security and performance.

<!-- ### Feature Requests

I’ve also streamlined the process for feature requests, allowing anyone interested in the project to suggest improvements. Your feedback is invaluable, and I’m excited to incorporate ideas that can elevate the project to the next level.

### Cloudflare

Additionally, I’ve integrated GitHub actions via Cloudflare, adding an extra layer of security and performance. It’s reassuring to know my code is protected while benefiting from Cloudflare’s speed.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

To further enhance my development process, I’ve set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing and deployment.  -->

<summary>View workflow configuration</summary>

```yaml

name: Deploy
concurrency: development
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: development
    permissions:
      contents: read
      deployments: write
    timeout-minutes: 30
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
            fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Node setup
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: lts/*

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
            cd website
            npm ci && npm run build
            
      - name: Deploy
        uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1.5.0
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          projectName: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME }}
          directory: ${{ secrets.BUILD_DIR }}
          gitHubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          wranglerVersion: '3'
```
This workflow ensures that every push and pull request triggers tests, helping me maintain code quality and reliability.
