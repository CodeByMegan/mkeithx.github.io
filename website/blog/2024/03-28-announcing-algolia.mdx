Today, I'm thrilled to announce that my [website](https://mkeithx.github.io/) now features SEARCH functionality, powered by [Algolia](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

Also, I'm happy to share my custom configuration that includes Crawlers outlined in [**this article**](#).


<!-- ## What's next?

Custom configuration for DocSearch and crawlers for Docusaurus ```--typescript``` variant. Stay tuned! -->
