## Highlights

### Cloudflare Pages
Safety is still the No.1 priority. As noted [previously](/blog/devops-july#cloudflare-pages), I'm delighted to announce that the site is now being serve by Cloudflare 100%. 

This includes Wrangler package and the implementation of a new deployment workflow. I am looking forward to deprecate all previous CIs configs as described the [PR#80](https://github.com/mkeithX/mkeithx.github.io/pull/80). 

While I am currently testing its capabilities and functionalities, I don't see any compatibility issues that impacts the website performance. Feel free report if see one.
