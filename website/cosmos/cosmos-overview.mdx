# Galactic Gazette ðŸš€

:::tip[What's inside...]

:::

Hello and welcome to **Galactic Gazette**. This section is where I share my knowledge and topics that I come across about the Universe. Initially, three major topics were included during the website's development:

- âœ… **Astrophysics**: Delving into the properties and behaviors of celestial bodies within the cosmos ðŸ”­
- âœ… **The Solar System**: A star and everything that orbits around it due to gravity.
- âœ… **Legacy**: Highlighting scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and influential figures in physics, astronomy, and space exploration.

Before delving in, it's crucial to grasp the fundamental aspects of these topics, starting with [**The Four Fundamental Forces of the Universe**](./may-the-force.mdx).
