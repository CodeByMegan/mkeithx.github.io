<!-- ## Overview -->

This section highlights everything about the universe and serves as the core of my secondary motivation for building this website. Here, you won't find any technical articles; rather, the purpose of crafting this section is to share the knowledge I come across about the universe.

Ranging from our very own [solar system](/cosmos/solar-system),[astrophysics](/cosmos/astrophysics) (in simple terms), [the legacies](/cosmos/legacy) of some influential figures in physics, astronomy, and space exploration, and beyond.

## In a Nutshell

### Through the Ages

<!-- From the speculative philosophy of the ancient Greeks to the precise mathematical formulations of modern physics, our understanding of the universe has undergone a remarkable evolution.  -->

From the ancient Greeks to modern-day scientists, humanity's understanding of the universe has evolved dramatically over the centuries. Each era brought new insights and revolutionary ideas that reshaped our perception of the cosmos.

### Aristotle

The Pioneers of Philosophy, the ancient Greeks laid the foundation for our understanding of the universe through philosophical inquiry. Thinkers like **Aristotle** proposed that the Earth was at the center of the cosmos, surrounded by concentric spheres carrying the stars and planets. This **geocentric** model dominated Western thought for centuries.

### Galileo Galilei

In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei challenged the prevailing beliefs of his time with the invention of the telescope. Through meticulous observation, he discovered celestial bodies like Jupiter's moons and the phases of Venus, providing evidence that supported the heliocentric model proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus. Galileo's work paved the way for a new era of scientific inquiry based on empirical evidence.

### Isaac Newton

The 17th and 18th centuries saw the emergence of Isaac Newton's groundbreaking theories of motion and gravitation. In his seminal work "_[PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](./legacy/exploring-principia)_," Newton described the universal law of gravitation, which explained how celestial bodies interacted with each other. His laws of motion provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamics of the universe, setting the stage for centuries of scientific progress.

### Albert Einstein

In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity with his [theory of general relativity](./legacy/special-general-relativity). Einstein's equations described gravity as the curvature of spacetime, challenging Newton's classical mechanics and providing new insights into the behavior of massive objects in the cosmos. His work also paved the way for the development of modern cosmology, leading to discoveries like the expanding universe and black holes.

## Summary

:::tip[A Journey of Discovery]

Each milestone in this journey has expanded our horizons and deepened our appreciation for the wonders of the cosmos. As we continue to explore the mysteries of the universe, we stand on the shoulders of giants who have shaped our understanding of the cosmos through centuries of inquiry and discovery.
