**Neptune** is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is a frigid world with vivid blue hues, strong winds, and a dynamic atmosphere.

### Characteristics

- **Atmosphere**: Neptune's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it its distinctive blue color. The planet's atmosphere exhibits high-speed winds and dynamic cloud patterns, including dark storms and bright clouds.
- **Moons and Rings**: Neptune has a system of moons and faint rings. Its largest moon, Triton, orbits the planet in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation, suggesting that it was captured by the planet's gravity after forming elsewhere in the solar system.
- **Discovery**: Neptune was the first planet to be discovered through mathematical calculations rather than direct observation. French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier predicted its existence based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit, leading to its discovery in 1846.
- **Space Exploration**: Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft to dateâ€”NASA's Voyager 2 probe, which flew by the planet in 1989. The flyby provided valuable data about Neptune's atmosphere, moons, and rings.

### Did you know?

- **Triton**: Triton is one of the most intriguing moons in the solar system. It is the only large moon in the solar system with a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits its parent planet in the opposite direction to the planet's rotation.
- **Dynamic Atmosphere**: Neptune's atmosphere exhibits rapid changes, including the formation and dissipation of large storms. The planet's Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, was observed by Voyager 2 but has since disappeared.
