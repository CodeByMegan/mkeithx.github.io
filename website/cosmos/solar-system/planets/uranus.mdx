**Uranus** is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest planet in the solar system. It is an ice giant with a unique sideways rotation, likely the result of a cataclysmic collision in its distant past.

### Characteristics

- **Tilted Axis**: Uranus is unique among the planets in that it rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation almost parallel to its orbit around the Sun. This unique orientation results in extreme seasons that last for decades.
- **Atmosphere**: Uranus has a predominantly hydrogen and helium atmosphere, with traces of methane. Its atmosphere exhibits bands of clouds and high-speed winds, although less is known about its weather compared to other gas giants.
- **Rings and Moons**: Uranus has a faint ring system and a retinue of moons, each with its own characteristics. The planet's rings are narrow and dark, composed of fine dust particles.
- **Space Exploration**: Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft to dateâ€”NASA's Voyager 2 probe, which flew by the planet in 1986. The flyby provided valuable data about Uranus' atmosphere, rings, and moons.

### Did you know?

- **Seasonal Changes**: Due to its extreme axial tilt, Uranus experiences dramatic seasonal changes as it orbits the Sun. During its long polar winters, one pole faces the Sun continuously, while the other remains in darkness.
