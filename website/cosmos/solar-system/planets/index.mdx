The term _"plan√≠tis,"_ coined by ancient Greek astronomers, translates to _"wanderer"_ or _"wandering star"_. In essence, planets are colossal, spherical bodies orbiting stars, with cleared paths devoid of debris. They bask in the glow of their stellar hosts, distinct from smaller celestial entities like asteroids and moons. Let's delve deeper into the essence of planets based on the criteria established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

## What are planets exactly?

According to the IAU, three criteria delineate a celestial object as a planet:

1. **Orbiting a Star:** Planets gracefully orbit stars, such as our radiant Sun (Helios), distinguishing them from satellites revolving around other planets.
2. **Spherical Shape:** Planets, sculpted by gravitational forces, assume spherical forms, unlike irregularly shaped asteroids and moons.
3. **Cleared Their Orbit:** Planets assert gravitational dominance, clearing their orbital paths of debris, and maintaining a pristine trajectory around their parent star.
