**Saturn** is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in the solar system, after Jupiter. It is known for its spectacular ring system, composed of countless icy particles.

### Characteristics

- **Ring System**: Saturn's rings are its most distinctive feature, consisting of icy particles ranging in size from micrometers to several meters. These rings are divided into several main groups, each named after a letter of the alphabet.
- **Atmosphere**: Like Jupiter, Saturn's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases. It also exhibits complex weather patterns, including storms and bands of clouds.
- **Moons**: Saturn has a diverse system of moons, with over 80 known moons and potentially more awaiting discovery. Its largest moon, Titan, is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere rich in nitrogen and methane.
- **Magnetic Field**: Saturn has a strong magnetic field, about 578 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field extends far into space and affects the environment around the planet and its moons.

### Did you know?

- **Cassini-Huygens Mission**: NASA's Cassini spacecraft, in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI), studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017, providing valuable data about the planet's rings, atmosphere, and moons.
- **Titan**: Titan is one of the most intriguing moons in the solar system. It has lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane on its surface, making it the only other body besides Earth known to have stable bodies of surface liquid.
