**Jupiter** is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the solar system. It is a gas giant with a diameter more than 11 times that of Earth and a mass over 300 times greater.

## Characteristics

- **Atmosphere**: Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the composition of the Sun. It also contains traces of other gases, including methane, ammonia, and water vapor.
- **Great Red Spot**: Jupiter is known for its iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm system that has been raging for centuries. It is so large that multiple Earths could fit inside it.
- **Moons**: Jupiter has a vast system of moons, with over 79 known moons and possibly more awaiting discovery. Its four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are known as the Galilean moons and were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
- **Magnetic Field**: Jupiter has a powerful magnetic field that is significantly stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field creates intense radiation belts around the planet, posing challenges for spacecraft and exploration.

### Did you know?

- **Galilean Moons**: The Galilean moons are among the most fascinating objects in the solar system. Europa, in particular, is considered a prime candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life due to its subsurface ocean.
- **Juno Mission**: NASA's Juno spacecraft has been studying Jupiter since 2016, providing unprecedented insights into the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior structure.
