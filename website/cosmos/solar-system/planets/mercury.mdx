The closest planet to the Sun is a small, rocky world with extreme temperature variations. Its surface is heavily cratered, evidence of impacts from asteroids and comets.

Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest. Its lack of a significant atmosphere means it has extreme temperature variations, swinging from scorching hot to freezing cold.

## Characteristics
<details>
<summary><b>Characteristics</b></summary>


- **Size and Composition**: Mercury is a rocky planet with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles), making it slightly larger than Earth's moon. Its surface is heavily cratered, evidence of numerous impacts from asteroids and comets.
- **Extreme Temperatures**: Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations. Surface temperatures can soar as high as 427 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day and plummet to -173 degrees Celsius (-280 degrees Fahrenheit) at night.
- **Orbital Characteristics**: Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.39 astronomical units (AU) and completes one orbit approximately every 88 Earth days. Its orbit is the most eccentric of all the planets in the solar system, meaning it has the most elongated and elliptical shape.
- **Lack of Moons**: Unlike most other planets, Mercury does not have any moons orbiting around it.
