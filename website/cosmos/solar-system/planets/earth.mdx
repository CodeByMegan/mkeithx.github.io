**Earth** is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It is the largest and densest of the inner planets, consisting mostly of rock and metal. Earth's atmosphere contains the right mix of gases, primarily nitrogen and oxygen, to sustain life as we know it.

## Characteristics

- **Diverse Ecosystems**: Earth boasts a wide variety of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and aquatic environments. These ecosystems support a vast array of plant and animal species, making Earth a uniquely biodiverse planet.
- **Water**: About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans, seas, and freshwater bodies. Water is essential for life and plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate and supporting ecosystems.
- **Magnetic Field**: Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by its iron-nickel core. This magnetic field extends into space and helps protect the planet from harmful solar radiation, making Earth habitable for life.
- **Rotation and Orbit**: Earth rotates on its axis, causing day and night cycles, and orbits the Sun in an elliptical path. It takes approximately 365.25 days for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, resulting in the changing of seasons.
- **Moon**: Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits the planet at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,900 miles). The Moon's gravitational influence causes ocean tides and has played a significant role in shaping Earth's geology and climate.

### Facts

- **Human Civilization**: Earth is the only known planet to support human civilization. It is home to over 7 billion people, who have developed diverse cultures, languages, and societies across its continents.
- **Climate Change**: Earth's climate is undergoing significant changes due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, leading to global warming and environmental degradation.
- **Space Exploration**: Humans have explored space beyond Earth's atmosphere, sending spacecraft to orbit the planet, land on its surface, and explore neighboring celestial bodies. These missions have provided valuable insights into Earth's place in the universe and the challenges of space exploration.
