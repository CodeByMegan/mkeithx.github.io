**Venus**, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet from the Sun. It is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid and has a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the **hottest planet** in our solar system. In simple terms, **Venus is HELL**.

### Characteristics

- **Atmosphere**: Venus has an incredibly thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, trapping heat and leading to its blistering surface temperatures, which can reach up to 462 degrees Celsius (864 degrees Fahrenheit).
- **Rotation**: Unlike most planets, Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to its orbit around the Sun, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation.
- **Surface**: The surface of Venus is rocky and volcanic, with vast plains, mountains, and thousands of volcanoes. It lacks oceans and water bodies due to its high surface temperature.

### Did you know?

- **No Moons**: Like Mercury, Venus doesn't have any moons orbiting around it.
- **Orbital Period**: Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 astronomical units (AU), completing one orbit approximately every 225 Earth days.
- **Extreme Pressure**: The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth's, equivalent to the pressure experienced deep beneath the ocean.

Despite its harsh conditions, Venus has captivated the imagination of scientists and astronomers for centuries, offering valuable insights into the workings of planetary atmospheres and climates.
