# The Rocky Worlds

## Exploring the Inner Planets

Welcome to the realm of the inner planets, a group of rocky worlds nestled closer to the Sun than their outer counterparts. Comprising **[Hermes](#mercury)**, **[Aphrodite](#venus)**, **[Gaia](#earth)**, and **[Ares](#mars)**, these terrestrial planets offer a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of planetary formation and evolution. 

## Mercury

> **_Hermes_**

The closest planet to the Sun is a small, rocky world with extreme temperature variations. Its surface is heavily cratered, evidence of impacts from asteroids and comets.

Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest. Its lack of a significant atmosphere means it has extreme temperature variations, swinging from scorching hot to freezing cold.

<details>
<summary><b>Characteristics</b></summary>


- **Size and Composition**: Mercury is a rocky planet with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles), making it slightly larger than Earth's moon. Its surface is heavily cratered, evidence of numerous impacts from asteroids and comets.
- **Extreme Temperatures**: Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations. Surface temperatures can soar as high as 427 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day and plummet to -173 degrees Celsius (-280 degrees Fahrenheit) at night.
- **Orbital Characteristics**: Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.39 astronomical units (AU) and completes one orbit approximately every 88 Earth days. Its orbit is the most eccentric of all the planets in the solar system, meaning it has the most elongated and elliptical shape.
- **Lack of Moons**: Unlike most other planets, Mercury does not have any moons orbiting around it.

- Mercury lacks moons and orbits the Sun at approximately 0.39 astronomical units (AU), equivalent to 57.9 million kilometers, completing its journey every 88 Earth days.
- To provide a relatable analogy, New Year's Eve celebrations occur every 88 days on Mercury, with its orbit akin to the distance from Manila to Quezon City in human terms.

## Venus

> **_Aphrodite_**

The second planet from the Sun is often called Earth's "sister planet." It is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid and has a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.

Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation. It also has an incredibly thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, trapping heat and leading to its blistering surface temperatures.

**In simple terms, Venus is HELL**.

<details>
<summary><b>Characteristics</b></summary>

- **Atmosphere**: Venus has an incredibly thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, trapping heat and leading to its blistering surface temperatures, which can reach up to 462 degrees Celsius (864 degrees Fahrenheit).
- **Rotation**: Unlike most planets, Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to its orbit around the Sun, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation.
- **Surface**: The surface of Venus is rocky and volcanic, with vast plains, mountains, and thousands of volcanoes. It lacks oceans and water bodies due to its high surface temperature.

</details>

#### Did You Know

:::tip[facts]

- Venus shares Mercury's lack of moons and orbits the Sun at about 0.72 AU, approximately 108.2 million kilometers away, completing an orbit every 225 Earth days.
- To illustrate its orbit's scale, New Year's Eve happens every 225 days on Venus, and roughly the distance from Manila to Calamba in human terms.

## Earth

> **_Gaia_**

**Our home planet, the third from the Sun**, is the only known celestial body to support life. Its diverse ecosystems, encompassing vast oceans and towering mountains, underscore its unparalleled beauty and ecological richness.

<details>
<summary><b>Characteristics</b></summary>


- **Diverse Ecosystems**: Earth boasts a wide variety of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and aquatic environments. These ecosystems support a vast array of plant and animal species, making Earth a uniquely biodiverse planet.
- **Water**: About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans, seas, and freshwater bodies. Water is essential for life and plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate and supporting ecosystems.
- **Magnetic Field**: Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by its iron-nickel core. This magnetic field extends into space and helps protect the planet from harmful solar radiation, making Earth habitable for life.
- **Rotation and Orbit**: Earth rotates on its axis, causing day and night cycles, and orbits the Sun in an elliptical path. It takes approximately 365.25 days for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, resulting in the changing of seasons.
- **Moon**: Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits the planet at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,900 miles). The Moon's gravitational influence causes ocean tides and has played a significant role in shaping Earth's geology and climate.

:::tip[Facts]

- Earth boasts a solitary moon and orbits the Sun at precisely 1.00 AU, approximately 149.6 million kilometers distant, completing an orbit every 365.25 days.
- To offer a relatable perspective, Earth's orbit spans the distance from Manila to Davao City in human terms.

## Mars

> **_Ares_**

**The fourth planet from the Sun**, often called the "Red Planet," has captured the imagination of scientists and explorers for centuries. It features towering volcanoes, deep canyons, and evidence of ancient rivers, suggesting it may have once harbored conditions conducive to life.

Mars has the tallest volcano in the solar systemâ€”Olympus Mons. It's over twice the height of Mount Everest and is part of a region known as the Tharsis volcanic plateau.

<details>
<summary><b>Characteristics</b></summary>

- **Surface Features**: Mars has a diverse range of surface features, including large volcanoes, deep canyons, and vast plains. The planet's most prominent feature is Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system.
- **Atmosphere**: Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. The planet's atmosphere is too thin to support human life as we know it, and its surface experiences extreme temperature variations.
- **Moons**: Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and likely captured asteroids. These moons orbit close to the planet and are thought to be remnants of a larger body that broke apart.
- **Exploration**: Mars has been a target for exploration by various space agencies, with numerous spacecraft and rovers sent to study its surface and atmosphere. These missions have provided valuable data about Mars' geology, climate, and potential for past or present life.

</details>

#### Did You Know

:::tip[facts]

- Mars counts two moons, Phobos and Deimos, and orbits the Sun at roughly 1.52 AU, about 227.9 million kilometers distant, completing an orbit every 687 Earth days.

- To put into perspective, New Year's Eve happens every 1.88 Earth years, and it's roughly the distance from Manila to Iloilo City in a human scale.
