# Timeline


From ancient Greece to modern times, humanity's comprehension of the universe has undergone profound evolution. Each era has introduced revolutionary ideas and new insights that have reshaped our understanding of the cosmos.

## Aristotle


Ancient Greek philosophers, notably Aristotle, laid the groundwork for our cosmic comprehension through philosophical inquiry. Aristotle's geocentric model, positioning Earth at the cosmos' center, held sway over Western thought for centuries.

## Galileo Galilei
In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei's invention of the telescope challenged prevailing beliefs. His meticulous observations, including the discovery of Jupiter's moons and Venus's phases, supported _Nicolaus Copernicus_' heliocentric model, ushering in an era of empirical inquiry.

## Isaac Newton
The 17th and 18th centuries saw Isaac Newton's groundbreaking theories of motion and gravitation. His work, exemplified in "_[Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](../cosmos/legacy/exploring-principia.mdx)_," described the universal law of gravitation and provided a comprehensive framework for understanding celestial dynamics.

## Albert Einstein
In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein's [theory of general relativity](../cosmos/legacy/special-general-relativity.mdx) revolutionized our perception of space, time, and gravity. His equations, defining gravity as spacetime curvature, challenged classical mechanics and laid the foundation for modern cosmology, leading to discoveries like the expanding universe and black holes.
