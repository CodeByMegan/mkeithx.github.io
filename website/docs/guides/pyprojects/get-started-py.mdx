# Overview

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Known for its simplicity and versatility, Python is widely used in various fields including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Python offers a powerful and intuitive language for building applications of all kinds.

## Why Python?

- ✅ **Easy to Learn:** Python's syntax is clear and concise, making it easy for beginners to grasp the basics of programming.
- ✅ **Versatile:** Python can be used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and much more.
- ✅ **Large Community:** With a vast community of developers, Python offers extensive libraries and frameworks to accomplish virtually any task.
- ✅ **Cross-Platform:** Python is available on all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Setting Up Python

Before diving into Python programming, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Python:** Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to complete the setup.

2. **Verify Installation:** Once Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to verify the installation:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
   
   ```bash
   py --version
   ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix">
  
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see the installed version of Python printed on the screen.

## Your First Python Program

Now that you have Python installed, let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started:

```py
# hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the above code in a file named hello.py. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where hello.py is saved, and type the following command to run the program:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

  ```py
  py hello.py
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix">
  

```py
python hello.py
```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>






You should see the output Hello, World! printed on the screen.

## Python Code Snippets

Here are a few Python code snippets to help you get familiar with the language:

1. Variables and Data Types

```py
# Variables and Data Types
name = "John"
age = 30
is_student = False
```

2. Lists

```py
## List:
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

3. Loops

```py
# Loops
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

4. Functions

```py
# Functions
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

5. Control Flow Statements

#### If-Else Statement

```py
# If-Else Statement
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

#### While Loop

```py
# While Loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

#### For Loop

```py
# For Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
