# Adding Algolia Search to Docusaurus V3

Docusaurus V3 is a powerful tool for creating static websites with ease, but one feature it lacks out of the box is search functionality. Fortunately, integrating Algolia search into your Docusaurus site is a straightforward process that greatly enhances the user experience. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to add Algolia search to your Docusaurus V3 site.

## What is Algolia?

[Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) is a powerful search-as-a-service platform that provides lightning-fast and relevant search capabilities for websites and applications. It offers easy-to-use APIs and comprehensive documentation, making it a popular choice for adding search functionality to websites.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Docusaurus V3 site set up and running.
- An Algolia account. You can sign up for a free account on the [Algolia website](https://www.algolia.com/).

## Step 1: Install Algolia's JavaScript API Client

To get started, we need to install Algolia's JavaScript API Client. Run the following command in your Docusaurus project directory:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install algoliasearch
```
## Step 2: Create an Algolia Account and Index
If you haven't already, sign up for an Algolia account. Once logged in, create a new index for your Docusaurus site. Make note of your Application ID, Search-Only API Key, and Index Name as we'll need these later.


## Step 3: Configure Algolia Search in Docusaurus
In your Docusaurus project, locate the docusaurus.config.js file and add the following Algolia search configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  ...
  algolia: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME',
    appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
    // Optional: see Algolia's DocSearch documentation for advanced options
    // https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs
    contextualSearch: true,
  },
  ...
};
```

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME', and 'YOUR_APP_ID' with the corresponding values from your Algolia account.


## Step 4: Implement Search UI Component
Finally, add a search UI component to your Docusaurus site. You can place this component in your header or sidebar, depending on your site's layout preferences. Here's a simple example of how you can implement it:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { InstantSearch, SearchBox, Hits } from 'react-instantsearch-dom';

const Search = () => (
  <InstantSearch
    appId="YOUR_APP_ID"
    apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
    indexName="YOUR_INDEX_NAME"
  >
    <SearchBox />
    <Hits />
  </InstantSearch>
);

export default Search;
```

Don't forget to replace the placeholder values with your actual Algolia credentials.

## Step 5: Build and Deploy Your Site
Once you've completed the above steps, rebuild your Docusaurus site by running:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

Deploy your site as usual. Your Docusaurus site should now have Algolia search functionality enabled!
