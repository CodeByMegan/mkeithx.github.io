## Setting Up Python

Before diving into Python programming, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Python:** Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to complete the setup.

2. **Verify Installation:** Once Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to verify the installation:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
   
   ```bash
   py --version
   ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix">
  
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see the installed version of Python printed on the screen.

## Your First Python Program

Now that you have Python installed, let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started:

```py
# hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the above code in a file named hello.py. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where hello.py is saved, and type the following command to run the program:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

  ```py
  py hello.py
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix">
  

```py
python hello.py
```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
