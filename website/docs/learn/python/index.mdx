# Python
## Installation

### Py on Windows

To install Python on Windows, download the official Python .exe installer and follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Select Python Version
Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020. **We recommend Python 3** unless you need Python 2 for legacy projects. Opt for a stable release over the newest to avoid bugs.

### Step 2: Download Python
1. Visit the [Python Downloads for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) page.
2. Select the desired version (32-bit or 64-bit installer) and click to download.

2. Ensure the following options are checked:

   - **Install for all users**: Installs Python for all system users.
   
   - **Add Python to PATH**: Adds Python to the PATH variable automatically.

   For the most straightforward installation, we recommend ticking both checkboxes.
