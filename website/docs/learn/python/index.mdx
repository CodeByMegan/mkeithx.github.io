:::tip[Installation]

The installation requires downloading the official Python .exe installer and running it on your system. The sections below will explain several options and details during the installation process.

:::


### Select Python Version
Deciding on a version depends on what you want to do in Python. The two major versions are Python 2 and Python 3. Choosing one over the other might be better depending on your project details. If there are no constraints, choose whichever one you prefer.

:::danger[WARNING]

**We recommend Python 3**, as Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020. Download Python 2 only if you work with legacy scripts and older projects. Also, choose a stable release over the newest since the newest release may have bugs and issues.

:::

### Step 2: Download Python
Start by downloading the Python executable installer for Windows:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the [Downloads for Windows section](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) of the official Python website.
