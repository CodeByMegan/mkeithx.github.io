## Fundamentals

### First Fundamental Theorem

Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and let $F$ be the function defined by:

$$
F(x)= \int_{a}^{x}f(t) dt.
$$

Then, $F$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and $F'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$.

In simpler terms, if $f$ is a continuous function, and $F$ is the accumulation (or antiderivative) of $f$, then the derivative of $F$ is $f$.

### Second Fundamental Theorem

Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and let $F$ be any antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$. Then,

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

In other words, the definite integral of a function $f$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is equal to the difference between the antiderivative $F$ evaluated at $b$ and $F$ evaluated at $a$.
