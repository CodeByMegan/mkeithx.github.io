<!-- # The Keyword -->

## Welcome

**MKX SpaceHub**™ is a simple documentation website where I showcase some of my work, projects, including gists, and personal interests. It also serves as a milestone towards mastering technical writing and front-end technologies such [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).


## Motivation

### Effective documentation

In software development, championing clarity, collaboration, knowledge dissemination, and the enduring viability of projects. Its absence could lead to confusion, hindered development, and heightened error risks, underscoring its indispensable role in the software development lifecycle.

### Beyond technical

You'll get to find short articles about **[the Universe](/cosmos/overview)** - mostly related to physics a subject I've been fascinated with perhaps since day one.

I've included articles about physics, a subject I've been fascinated with perhaps since Genesis. Everything here is a work-in-progress, and as I continue to innovate, so does this website.

## Thank you

As I continue to build and innovate, I'll do my best to add new contents regularly and hopefully I'll get to inspire. My name is [**Keith**](./me) by the way and I'd like to thank you for checking in and hope you've enjoyed navigating **MKX SpaceHub**™.
