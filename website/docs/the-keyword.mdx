## Welcome

**MKX SpaceHub**™ is an open-source project authored and designed by [@mkeithX](./me), aiming to establish an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal offering valuable and accessible resources for everyone.


<!-- **MKX SpaceHub**™ is a simple documentation website where you can find project docs from [mkeithX](https://github.com/mkeithx) and [Kitiplex](https://kitiplex.github.io). Our goal is to enhance it further by transforming it into a comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal, offering valuable resources for everyone. Discover more about [the author](./me). -->

<!-- **MKX SpaceHub**™ is a simple, straight-forward documentation website where I showcase some of my work, projects, including gists, and personal interests. It also serves as a milestone towards mastering technical writing and front-end technologies such [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). -->

<summary>Effective documentation</summary>

Effective documentation is crucial in software development for promoting clarity, collaboration, and knowledge dissemination. It ensures the enduring viability of projects by reducing confusion, facilitating development, and mitigating error risks, making it an indispensable aspect of the software development lifecycle.

## Building the Hub

This website, built with Docusaurus, optimally leverages the full power of [React](https://react.dev/) for interactivity. Additionally, the  [TypeScript variant](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support#initialization) was selected for its optimal features suited to the project's scope. Learn more about how this project was [initialized](/docs/website-configuration). 



<!-- This website is built using the [Docusaurus TypeScript variant](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support#initialization) for various reasons, including early error detection. It also aims to compile all project docs from [mkeithX](https://github.com/mkeithx) and some demos from [Kitiplex](https://kitiplex.github.io). Check this [example](https://github.com/mkeithX/python-starters). Learn more about our [development process](/docs/contributing#development-process). -->



<!-- :::docusaurus[Important]
You can check out our [**development process**](/docs/contributing#development) to learn more. However, please note that it assumes you have basic knowledge of Git, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, package managers such as npm, yarn, pnpm, and Software Lifecycle.

 <!-- Additionally, it operates as a mono-repo and features three examples: Python code samples, Jupyter notebooks, and batch files. Learn more about our detailed [development process](/docs/contributing#development).  -->

<!-- This website is powered by Docusaurus, an open source static-site generator powered by [Meta](https://opensource.fb.com/projects/docusaurus)

a robust platform complemented by custom React imports, ensuring dynamic and engaging content. To maintain stability and reliability, we rely on Docusaurus's [TypeScript variant](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support#initialization), which excels at detecting errors early in the development process. -->


<!-- 
For robustness, we utilize Docusaurus's TypeScript variant, facilitating early error detection. Operating as a mono-repo, our platform showcases three distinct examples: Python code snippets, Jupyter notebooks, and batch files. Explore further insights into our meticulous development methodology.

Powered with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) with custom React imports enabling dynamic and interactive features. 

It is primarily written in .mdx, with custom React imports enabling dynamic and interactive features. These principles are applicable across all programming languages.

## Exploring the Cosmos 

Beyond technical documentation, you'll get to find articles covering fascinating topics about [the universe](/cosmos/overview). Ranging from our very own [solar system](/cosmos/solar-system), facts about [celestial mechanics](/cosmos/astrophysics), some influential [figures in physics](/cosmos/legacy), astronomy, and space exploration, and beyond.



<!-- ## Beyond technical

You'll get to find short articles about **[the Universe](/cosmos/overview)** - mostly related to physics a subject I've been fascinated with perhaps since day one.  From stars and galaxies to the mysteries of space, these articles offer a fascinating look at the wonders of physics and astronomy. -->


<!-- ## Thank you

As I continue to build and innovate, I'll regularly add new content, aiming to inspire along the way. I'm [**Keith**](./me) by the way and I'd like to thank you for checking in and hope you've enjoyed navigating **MKX SpaceHub**™. -->
