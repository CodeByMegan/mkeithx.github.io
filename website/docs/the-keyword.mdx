## Welcome

**MKX SpaceHub**™ is an open-source project authored and designed by [Keith](./me), aiming to establish an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal offering valuable and accessible resources for everyone.


<!-- **MKX SpaceHub**™ is a simple documentation website where you can find project docs from [mkeithX](https://github.com/mkeithx) and [Kitiplex](https://kitiplex.github.io). Our goal is to enhance it further by transforming it into a comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal, offering valuable resources for everyone. Discover more about [the author](./me). -->

<!-- **MKX SpaceHub**™ is a simple, straight-forward documentation website where I showcase some of my work, projects, including gists, and personal interests. It also serves as a milestone towards mastering technical writing and front-end technologies such [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). -->

## Building the Web

The website is built using the [Docusaurus TypeScript variant](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support#initialization) for various reasons, including early error detection. Additionally, it operates as a mono-repo and features three examples: Python code samples, Jupyter notebooks, and batch files. Learn more about our detailed [development process](/docs/contributing#development).


## Exploring the Cosmos

Beyond technical documentation, MKX SpaceHub™ offers a diverse range of articles covering fascinating topics about [the universe](/cosmos/overview). Delve into applied physics and explore intriguing facts that illuminate the mysteries of our cosmos. From discussions on celestial mechanics to insights into astrophysical phenomena, there's something for everyone to explore and enjoy. 

<!-- ## Beyond technical

You'll get to find short articles about **[the Universe](/cosmos/overview)** - mostly related to physics a subject I've been fascinated with perhaps since day one.  From stars and galaxies to the mysteries of space, these articles offer a fascinating look at the wonders of physics and astronomy. -->


<!-- ## Thank you

As I continue to build and innovate, I'll regularly add new content, aiming to inspire along the way. I'm [**Keith**](./me) by the way and I'd like to thank you for checking in and hope you've enjoyed navigating **MKX SpaceHub**™. -->
