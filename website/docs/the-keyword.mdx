## Welcome

**MKX SpaceHub**™ is a simple, straight-forward documentation website where I showcase some of my work, projects, including gists, and personal interests. It also serves as a milestone towards mastering technical writing and front-end technologies such [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

<summary>Effective documentation</summary>

Effective documentation is crucial in software development for promoting clarity, collaboration, and knowledge dissemination. It ensures the enduring viability of projects by reducing confusion, facilitating development, and mitigating error risks, making it an indispensable aspect of the software development lifecycle.

## Beyond technical

You'll get to find short articles about **[the Universe](/cosmos/overview)** - mostly related to physics a subject I've been fascinated with perhaps since day one.  From stars and galaxies to the mysteries of space, these articles offer a fascinating look at the wonders of physics and astronomy.


## Thank you

As I continue to build and innovate, I'll regularly add new content, aiming to inspire along the way. I'm [**Keith**](./me) by the way and I'd like to thank you for checking in and hope you've enjoyed navigating **MKX SpaceHub**™.
