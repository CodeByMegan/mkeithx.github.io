The project aims to establish an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal using various technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, to offer valuable and accessible resources for IT Developers, Helpdesk Analysts, and Amateur Astronomers. Learn more about the [author](./me).


## What's Inside?
The contents of this website include project documentation or READMEs from all repositories, along with [gists](https://mkeithx.github.io/docs/cheat-sheets) and [tutorials](https://mkeithx.github.io/docs/guides).

Beyond technical documentation, you'll find articles covering fascinating topics about [the universe](../cosmos/). Ranging from our very own [solar system](../cosmos/solar-system/), facts about [celestial mechanics](../cosmos/astrophysics), some influential [figures in physics](../cosmos/legacy), astronomy, and space exploration, and beyond. 

<!-- ## Building the Hub

This website, built with Docusaurus, optimally leverages the full power of [React](https://react.dev/) for interactivity. Additionally, the  [TypeScript variant](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support#initialization) was selected for its optimal features suited to the project's scope. Learn more about how this project was [initialized](/docs/configuration).  -->

## Motivation

This project is motivated and inspired by the [Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) otherwise known as the 80/20 where:

- ✅ We can get 80% of the results for 20% of the effort;

- ✅ 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs.
