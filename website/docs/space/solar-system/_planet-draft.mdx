# Solar System Documentation: Planetary Comparison

## Overview
Here's a comparison of the eight planets in our solar system based on their number of moons, distance from the Sun, orbital period, and their corresponding mythological namesakes.

## Comparison of Distances
To visualize the distances of the planets from the Sun in a more relatable manner, let's use a simple scale comparing them to distances between well-known locations in the Philippines, along with their equivalent distances in kilometers:

- **Mercury**: Roughly the distance from Manila to Quezon City (55,177,000 km).
- **Venus**: Comparable to the distance from Manila to Calamba (108,939,000 km).
- **Earth**: Represents the distance from Manila to Davao City (149,597,870 km).
- **Mars**: Similar to the distance from Manila to Iloilo City (227,943,824 km).
- **Jupiter**: Roughly the distance from Manila to Baguio City (778,340,821 km).
- **Saturn**: Comparable to the distance from Manila to Cebu City (1,426,666,422 km).
- **Uranus**: Represents the distance from Manila to Zamboanga City (2,870,658,186 km).
- **Neptune**: Similar to the distance from Manila to Davao City and back again (4,504,300,000 km).

This comparison provides a tangible sense of the vast distances between the planets in our solar system, using well-known locations in the Philippines for reference, along with their equivalent distances in kilometers.

## Comparison of Distances
To put the distances of the planets from the Sun into perspective, let's use a simple scale where 1 AU equals 10 centimeters. This scale allows us to visualize the vastness of the solar system in a more tangible way:
