# Overview

This article marks our first journey into the Universe. I'll be explaining the 8 planets in our solar system in simple terms and other interesting details that come along with them. Let's get started!

## Planets üåè

Ancient Greek astronomers called these objects **_"plan√≠tis"_**, which means **"wanderer"** or **"wandering star"**. In simple terms, planets are big, round things that go around stars and have cleaned their paths from stuff. They reflect light from the stars they go around and are different from smaller things in space like asteroids and moons.

### What are Planets exactly?

:::tip[Criteria]

According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), there are three criteria for an object to be considered a planet:

1. **Orbiting a Star**: Planets must orbit a star, like our Sun, rather than being satellites orbiting around another planet.
2. **Spherical Shape**: Planets are typically spherical in shape due to their gravity pulling them into a rounded form. This distinguishes them from smaller celestial bodies like asteroids and moons, which may have irregular shapes.
3. **Cleared Their Orbit**: Planets have cleared their orbital path of debris by exerting gravitational dominance over their surroundings. This means they have a clear orbit around their star without significant competing objects.

:::warning[Quick test]

Among the three criteria, can you guess which one **Pluto** fails?

<details>
  <summary>Here's why</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      Pluto meets the first two criteria, but it fails the third.
      <b>
        {" "}
        Its orbit overlaps with that of Neptune, and it shares its orbital neighborhood
        with other objects in the Kuiper Belt.{" "}
      </b>
      Therefore, Pluto is classified as a "dwarf planet" rather than a
      full-fledged planet.

## Mercury

> _messenger of the gods, Hermes_

**The closest planet to the Sun** is a small, rocky world with extreme temperature variations. Its surface is heavily cratered, evidence of impacts from asteroids and comets.

Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest. Its lack of a significant atmosphere means it has extreme temperature variations, swinging from scorching hot to freezing cold.


:::tip[Did you know?]

Mercury doesn't have any moons, and it's about 0.39 AU or 57.9 million kilometers away from the Sun. Its orbit takes about 88 Earth days.

To give you an idea, New Year's Eve happens every 88 days, and it's roughly the distance from Manila to Quezon City in a human scale.

## Venus

> _the goddess of Love, Aphrodite_

**The second planet from the Sun** is often called Earth's "sister planet." It is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid and has a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the **hottest planet** in our solar system. In simple terms, **Venus is HELL**.

Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation. It also has an incredibly thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, trapping heat and leading to its blistering surface temperatures.

:::tip[Did you know?]

Like Mercury, Venus doesn't have any moons, and it's about 0.72 AU or 108.2 million kilometers away from the Sun. Its orbit takes about 225 Earth days.

To put this into perspective, New Year's Eve happens every 225 days, and it's roughly the distance from Manila to Calamba in a human scale.

## Earth

> _the god of the Earth, Gaia_

**Our home planet, the third from the Sun**, is the only known celestial body to support life. It boasts a diverse range of ecosystems, from vast oceans to towering mountains, making it a unique and precious world in the cosmos.

Earth's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen and oxygen, which is essential for supporting life as we know it. It also has a magnetic field that protects the planet from harmful solar radiation.

:::tip[Did you know?]

Earth has 1 moon, and it's about 1.00 AU or 149.6 million kilometers away from the Sun. It takes about 365.25 days to orbit around the Sun.

In a human scale, Earth is about the distance from Manila to Davao City.

## Mars

> _god of war, Ares_

**The fourth planet from the Sun**, often called the "Red Planet," has captured the imagination of scientists and explorers for centuries. It features towering volcanoes, deep canyons, and evidence of ancient rivers, suggesting it may have once harbored conditions conducive to life.

Mars has the tallest volcano in the solar system‚ÄîOlympus Mons. It's over twice the height of Mount Everest and is part of a region known as the Tharsis volcanic plateau.

:::tip[Did you know?]

Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, and it's about 1.52 AU or roughly 227.9 million kilometers away from the Sun. Its orbit takes about 687 Earth days.

To put into perspective, New Year's Eve happens every 1.88 Earth years, and it's roughly the distance from Manila to Iloilo City in a human scale.

## The Sun

> _the star at the center of our solar system_

**The Sun**, often referred to as a **"yellow dwarf" star**, is the heart of our solar system. It is an enormous, glowing sphere of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The Sun's immense gravitational pull keeps all the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets in orbit around it.

### Characteristics

- **Size**: The Sun is about 109 times the diameter of Earth, making it the largest object in our solar system.
- **Temperature**: Its surface temperature exceeds 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit), while the core temperature reaches over 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit).
- **Energy Source**: The Sun generates energy through the process of nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of light and heat.

### Importance

The Sun plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth. It provides the light and warmth necessary for photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants produce oxygen and organic compounds essential for all living organisms. Additionally, the Sun's gravitational pull governs the orbits of the planets, maintaining the stability of our solar system.


### Did you know?

:::tip[]

**Solar Flares**: Occasionally, the Sun emits powerful bursts of energy called solar flares, which can disrupt satellite communications and power grids on Earth.

**Sunspots**: Dark spots on the Sun's surface, known as sunspots, are areas of intense magnetic activity. They can vary in size and are cooler than the surrounding regions, appearing dark against the Sun's bright surface.

Despite its immense distance from Earth, the Sun's influence extends far beyond its physical reach, shaping the dynamics of our planet and the entire solar system.


## Jupiter

> _king of gods, Zeus_

**The fifth planet from the Sun and largest planet in the solar system**, Jupiter is known for its iconic Great Red Spot‚Äîa massive storm system that has raged for centuries. It has a diverse array of moons and a powerful magnetic field. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for at least 400 years. It's so large that multiple Earths could fit inside it.

:::tip[Did you know?]

Jupiter has a total of 79 known moons (_and counting_) and it's about 5.20 AU or 778.3 million kilometers away from the Sun.

If you get to settle in this massive gas giant, New Year's Eve happens every 4,333 days and roughly the distance from Manila to Baguio City in a human scale.

## Saturn

> _god of agriculture, Cronus_

**The sixth planet from the Sun**, Saturn's most distinctive feature is its spectacular ring system, composed of countless icy particles. It is a gas giant with swirling storms and a complex system of moons, including the intriguing Titan.

Despite its enormous size, Saturn has a relatively fast rotation period, completing one full rotation on its axis in just over 10 hours. This rapid rotation causes the planet to bulge at its equator, making it appear flattened.

Saturn has a strong magnetic field, about 578 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. This magnetic field extends far into space and affects the environment around the planet and its moons.

:::tip[Did you know?]

Saturn currently has 82 moons, and it's about 9.58 AU or 1.43 billion kilometers away from the Sun. Completing its orbit around the Sun in 10,759 Earth days, New Year's Eve happens every 29.48 Earth years.

In a human scale, it's roughly the distance from Manila to Cebu City.

## Uranus

> _god of the sky_

**The seventh planet from the Sun, an ice giant** with a unique sideways rotation, likely the result of a cataclysmic collision in its distant past. It has a faint ring system and a retinue of moons, each with its own characteristics. Uranus is tilted on its side, with its axis of rotation almost parallel to its orbit around the Sun. This unique orientation results in extreme seasons that last for decades.

:::tip[Did you know?]

Uranus currently has 27 moons, and it's about 19.22 AU or 2.87 billion kilometers away from the Sun. If you get to settle in this massive planet, New Year's Eve happens every 84.07 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).

In a human scale, its more likely traveling from Manila to Zamboanga City.

## Neptune

> _god of the sea, Poseidon_

**The eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun**, Neptune, is a frigid world with vivid blue hues. It has strong winds and a dynamic atmosphere, along with a system of moons and faint rings. Its largest moon, Triton, orbits the planet in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation. This backward motion suggests that Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity after forming elsewhere in the solar system.

:::tip[Did you know?]

French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier predicted its existence based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit, making it the first planet ever discovered through mathematical calculations.

Neptune has 14 moons, about 30.05 AU or 4.5 billion kilometers away from the Sun. Completing its orbit in 60,190 Earth days, New Year's Eve happens every 164.90 Earth years.

In simpler terms, Neptune's journey is comparable to a round-trip from Manila to Davao City.
