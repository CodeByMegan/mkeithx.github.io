## Asteroids üåë

Asteroids are rocky remnants from the early solar system, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They vary in size from tiny pebbles to large, irregularly shaped bodies.

The asteroid belt are spread out over vast distances, making collisions between them extremely rare.

## Comets ‚òÑÔ∏è

**Comets are icy bodies** that originate from the outer reaches of the solar system. As they approach the Sun, they often develop long tails through the sublimation of ice. This process results in the formation of a glowing coma, along with striking tails composed of dust and gas, which are frequently observed.

Halley's Comet, one of the most famous comets, returns to the inner solar system roughly every 76 years. Its last appearance was in 1986, and it won't be visible again until 2061.
