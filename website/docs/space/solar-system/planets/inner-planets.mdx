# The Rocky Worlds

## Exploring the Inner Planets

Welcome to the realm of the inner planets, a group of rocky worlds nestled closer to the Sun than their outer counterparts. Comprising **[Hermes](#mercury)**, **[Aphrodite](#venus)**, **[Gaia](#earth)**, and **[Ares](#mars)**, 😆 these terrestrial planets offer a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of planetary formation and evolution. 

## Mercury

> **_Hermes_**

The closest planet to the Sun is a small, rocky world with extreme temperature variations. Its surface is heavily cratered, evidence of impacts from asteroids and comets.

Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest. Its lack of a significant atmosphere means it has extreme temperature variations, swinging from scorching hot to freezing cold.

#### Did You Know

- Mercury lacks moons and orbits the Sun at approximately 0.39 astronomical units (AU), equivalent to 57.9 million kilometers, completing its journey every 88 Earth days.
- To provide a relatable analogy, New Year's Eve celebrations occur every 88 days on Mercury, with its orbit akin to the distance from Manila to Quezon City in human terms.

## Venus

> **_Aphrodite_**

The second planet from the Sun is often called Earth's "sister planet." It is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid and has a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.

Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation. It also has an incredibly thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, trapping heat and leading to its blistering surface temperatures.

**In simple terms, Venus is HELL**.

#### Did You Know

:::tip[info]

- Venus shares Mercury's lack of moons and orbits the Sun at about 0.72 AU, approximately 108.2 million kilometers away, completing an orbit every 225 Earth days.
- To illustrate its orbit's scale, New Year's Eve happens every 225 days on Venus, and roughly the distance from Manila to Calamba in human terms.

## Earth

> **_Gaia_**

**Our home planet, the third from the Sun**, is the only known celestial body to support life. Its diverse ecosystems, encompassing vast oceans and towering mountains, underscore its unparalleled beauty and ecological richness.

#### Did You Know

:::tip[info]

- Earth boasts a solitary moon and orbits the Sun at precisely 1.00 AU, approximately 149.6 million kilometers distant, completing an orbit every 365.25 days.
- To offer a relatable perspective, Earth's orbit spans the distance from Manila to Davao City in human terms.

## Mars

> **_Ares_**

**The fourth planet from the Sun**, often called the "Red Planet," has captured the imagination of scientists and explorers for centuries. It features towering volcanoes, deep canyons, and evidence of ancient rivers, suggesting it may have once harbored conditions conducive to life.

Mars has the tallest volcano in the solar system—Olympus Mons. It's over twice the height of Mount Everest and is part of a region known as the Tharsis volcanic plateau.

#### Did You Know

:::tip[info]

- Mars counts two moons, Phobos and Deimos, and orbits the Sun at roughly 1.52 AU, about 227.9 million kilometers distant, completing an orbit every 687 Earth days.

- To put into perspective, New Year's Eve happens every 1.88 Earth years, and it's roughly the distance from Manila to Iloilo City in a human scale.
