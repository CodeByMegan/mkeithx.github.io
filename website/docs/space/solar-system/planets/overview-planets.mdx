# A Tour of Our Solar System


This article marks our very first journey into the cosmos! In this expedition, we'll unravel the mysteries and wonders of the nine celestial bodies in our solar system, accompanied by intriguing facts and captivating narratives. So, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for an exhilarating voyage through space and time.

## Celestial Wanderers

The term _"plan√≠tis,"_ coined by ancient Greek astronomers, translates to _"wanderer"_ or _"wandering star"_. In essence, planets are colossal, spherical bodies orbiting stars, with cleared paths devoid of debris. They bask in the glow of their stellar hosts, distinct from smaller celestial entities like asteroids and moons. Let's delve deeper into the essence of planets based on the criteria established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

## What are planets exactly?

According to the IAU, three criteria delineate a celestial object as a planet:

1. **Orbiting a Star:** Planets gracefully orbit stars, such as our radiant Sun (Helios), distinguishing them from satellites revolving around other planets.
2. **Spherical Shape:** Planets, sculpted by gravitational forces, assume spherical forms, unlike irregularly shaped asteroids and moons.
3. **Cleared Their Orbit:** Planets assert gravitational dominance, clearing their orbital paths of debris, and maintaining a pristine trajectory around their parent star.

## Go for Launch

Now, let's embark on an expedition across the diverse landscapes of each planetary realm, beginning with the inner planet and also the closest to the Sun: **Mercury**.

T-10 seconds to liftoff

Mission Control: "Attention all personnel, we are now T-10 seconds to liftoff. Prepare for launch sequence initiation."

Engineers and technicians double-check systems and confirm readiness.

Mission Control: "All systems are green, and we are go for launch. Initiating final countdown sequence."

Attention turns to monitoring vital signs of the spacecraft.

Mission Control: "T-5 seconds... 4... 3... 2... 1... Ignition sequence initiated. Liftoff!"

Cheers erupt in the control room as the spacecraft begins its journey into the cosmos.
