Authored and designed by [@mkeithX](/me), this project aims to establish an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal using various technologies including **Artificial Intelligence** offering valuable and accessible resources for everyone.

Additionally, this project is innovatively inspired by the [Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) otherwise known as the 80/20 where:

- We can get 80% of the results for 20% of the effort;

- 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs.
