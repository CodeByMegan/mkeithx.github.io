While users can set their own wallpapers, managing lock screen and desktop images centrally with Intune ensures a consistent and professional appearance across all devices. This approach provides several benefits:
- **Security Information**: Centralized wallpaper management lets organizations display important security reminders and emergency contact details on lock screens and desktops.
- **Corporate Identity**: Uniform corporate wallpapers across devices reinforce brand identity, showcasing the company logo, colors, and branding to leave a lasting impression on clients and visitors.
