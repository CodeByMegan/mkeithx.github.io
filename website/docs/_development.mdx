# Development

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and relies on [GitHub](https://github.com/login) as its main repository and primary source of truth.  All pull requests will be checked by the continuous integration system, GitHub actions.

My goal is to optimize its development as a single repository (mono-repo), ensuring all code, documentation, and related assets are efficiently managed and easily accessible.

Made possible with the following tools and technologies:


[![vscode](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[![React](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
[![Js](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=javascript)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
[![Ts](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=typescript)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
[![Git](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=git)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
[![Python](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
