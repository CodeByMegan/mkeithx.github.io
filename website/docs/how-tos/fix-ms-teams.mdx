## 2. **Poor Call Quality**

If your calls are choppy or unclear:

- **Check Your Internet Connection:** A stable connection is crucial. Test your speed and switch to a wired connection if possible.
- **Close Other Applications:** Make sure other applications aren’t using too much bandwidth.
- **Adjust Audio Settings:** Check your audio device settings within Teams to ensure the correct microphone and speaker are selected.

## 3. **Teams Not Syncing Messages**

If messages aren’t appearing or syncing:

- **Restart Teams:** Close and reopen the application.
- **Check for Updates:** Ensure you’re using the latest version of Teams. Click on your profile picture and select **Check for updates**.
- **Sign Out and Back In:** This can help refresh your session and sync messages.

## 4. **Screen Sharing Issues**

If you’re having trouble sharing your screen:

- **Check Permissions:** Ensure Teams has the necessary permissions to share your screen.
- **Close Other Sharing Applications:** Other applications using screen sharing might conflict with Teams.
- **Try Different Browsers:** If you’re using Teams in a browser, switching to a different one may resolve issues.
