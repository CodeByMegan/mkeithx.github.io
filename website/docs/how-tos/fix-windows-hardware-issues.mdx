# Fix Windows Hardware Issues
A straightforward guide to help you fix hardware issues in Windows.

#### 1. Check Device Manager
Device Manager shows all your computer’s hardware. Look for devices with a yellow exclamation mark, which indicates a problem.

- **Open Device Manager**: Press `Win + X`, then select "Device Manager".
- **Identify Issues**: Right-click on devices with issues and select "Properties" to see details.

#### 2. Update Drivers
Outdated drivers can cause hardware malfunctions. Use PowerShell to update them:

- **Update Drivers**: Open PowerShell (`Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)").
  ```shell
  # List installed drivers
  Get-WindowsDriver -Online
  
  # Update a specific driver
  Update-WindowsDriver -Name "DriverName"
  ```

#### 3. Check Hardware Compatibility
Ensure your hardware is compatible with your version of Windows. Check manufacturer specifications and compatibility lists.

#### 4. Adjust Power Settings
Improper power settings can affect hardware performance. Set a suitable power plan:

- **Manage Power Plans**: Open PowerShell as administrator.
  ```shell
  # List power plans
  powercfg /l
  
  # Set active power plan (replace GUID with desired plan's GUID)
  powercfg /setactive GUID
  ```

#### 5. Test Hardware Components
If you suspect hardware issues, testing components can help identify problems:

- **Check Disk Health**: Use PowerShell to monitor disk health.
  ```shell
  Get-PhysicalDisk | Get-StorageReliabilityCounter
  ```

- **Check RAM**: Verify RAM details.
  ```shell
  Get-CimInstance Win32_PhysicalMemory | Format-Table Capacity, Manufacturer, Speed
  ```

- **Check CPU**: Get CPU information.
  ```shell
  Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Processor | Select-Object -Property *
  ```

#### 6. Check Event Viewer
Event Viewer logs system events, including hardware errors or warnings.

- **Open Event Viewer**: Press `Win + X`, then select "Event Viewer".

#### 7. Monitor System Temperature
Overheating can cause hardware issues. Use tools or PowerShell to monitor temperatures:

- **Check System Temperature**: Monitor temperatures to ensure components aren’t overheating.
  ```shell
  Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\wmi -Class MSStorageDriver_ATAPISmartData | Select-Object -ExpandProperty VendorSpecific
  ```

#### 8. Physical Inspection
Inspect hardware for physical damage or loose connections. Ensure everything is properly connected.

#### 9. Reinstall Hardware
As a last resort, reinstall hardware components if issues persist.
