:::caution[Deprecation warning]

A new and improved version of this project is rolling out soon. [**Learn more**](/blog/the-may-upgrade#deprecation).

:::

## Overview

MSP ``beta`` is one of my recent projects, expanding upon the [IUIU project](https://kitiplex.github.io/iuiu/docs/joey) and transforming it into a comprehensive **Knowledge Base** website.

This project is innovatively inspired by the [**Pareto Principle**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) otherwise known as the 80/20 where:

- We can get 80% of the results for 20% of the effort;

- 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs.

<!-- Inspired by various tools used in my current workplace, MSP ``beta`` serves as a testing ground aimed at streamlining processes and enhancing work efficiency. -->

## Technology

It is primarily written in `.mdx`, with custom React imports enabling dynamic and interactive features. These principles are applicable across all programming languages.
