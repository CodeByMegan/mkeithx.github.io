# Hello, hoooman! 

I'm a dedicated software engineer with a passion for crafting innovative solutions. My expertise lies in Django, Python, Conda, and ReactJS.  My coding journey intertwines with a love for pizza,tackling foobars, a fascination with physics, and my role as a co-founder at [Kitiplex](https://github.com/kitiplex).


<!-- Beyond coding, I have a special place in my heart for pizza—I love it more than ever. From tackling foobars to exploring everything else in the vast landscape of software development, join me in this journey through projects, technologies, and the occasional pizza break!🍕 -->
