###  Hello, world! üåç

The purpose of this website is to showcase and share some of my work, projects, demos, and my interests in my coding journey, which includes a love for pizza, tackling ``Foobars``, a fascination with understanding the complex of the univers and all other stuff. Everything here is a work-in-progress, and I hope you'll enjoy exploring to learn more about what I do.

<!-- __Welcome to my web portfolio__ ‚Äì a cozy digital corner where I'm excited to show off the things I've been working on. Here, you'll find a mix of my projects, from nifty workarounds to handy code snippets, and of course, a peek into the creation of this very  __[website](../docs/tutorials/docusaurus/index.mdx)__.

As you scroll through, you'll catch a glimpse of my coding journey. It's not just about lines of code; it's about the fun discoveries along the way. I have a soft spot for pizza ‚Äì a bit of a coding fuel, if you will. Tackling foobars, those quirky coding challenges, adds a dash of excitement to my coding adventures. I've got this fascination with physics too ‚Äì it's like my coding superpower.

Oh, and did I mention? I wear another hat as a co-founder at __[Kitiplex](https://kitiplex.github.io/)__. It's a project close to my heart, and you'll find a bit about it here too.

Feel free to click around, explore, and get to know more about the tech side of me. I'm thrilled to have you here! -->
