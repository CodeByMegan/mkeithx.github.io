###  Hello, world! üåç

The purpose of this website is to showcase and share some of my work, projects, demos, and my interests in my coding journey, which includes a love for pizza, tackling ``Foobars``, a fascination with understanding the complex of the universe and all other stuff. Everything here is a work-in-progress, and I hope you'll enjoy exploring to learn more about what I do.
