Welcome and thank you for visiting!

This website is part of my personal project aimed at establishing an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal using various technologies and frameworks to offer valuable and accessible resources for IT developers, helpdesk analysts, and amateur astronomers. More [about me](./me).

![mkeithx](../../public/img/github-banner.png)

## What's Inside?

Discover [docs](/docs/repo) from some of my projects, including [gists](/docs/cheat-sheets) and [tutorials](/docs/guides). Additionally, you'll find articles covering fascinating topics about the universe. Ranging from our very own solar system, facts about celestial mechanics, some influential figures in physics, astronomy, and space exploration, and beyond. [Learn more](../cosmos/).

## Tech Stuff

### Overview

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and relies on [GitHub](https://github.com/login) as its main repository and primary source of truth. My goal is to optimize its development as a single repository (mono-repo), ensuring all code, documentation, and related assets are efficiently managed and easily accessible.

### DevTools

I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to build this website along with helpful plugins and various [open-source resources](/community). While the main configuration may seem intricate, it aims to optimize the framework's performance. Learn [more](/docs/configuration).

<!-- ## Building the Hub

This website, built with Docusaurus, optimally leverages the full power of [React](https://react.dev/) for interactivity. Additionally, the  [TypeScript variant](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support#initialization) was selected for its optimal features suited to the project's scope. Learn more about how this project was [initialized](/docs/configuration).  -->

## Motivation

This project is motivated and inspired by the [Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) otherwise known as the 80/20 where:

- ✅ We can get 80% of the results for 20% of the effort;

- ✅ 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. -->

## Docs

Highlighting the importance of documentation in the software lifecycle & development.

<details>
<summary>Guidance</summary>

Effective documentation is indispensable in software development for numerous reasons. Primarily, it functions as a comprehensive guide, facilitating developers in comprehending the intricacies of the codebase, thereby easing the tasks of maintenance, troubleshooting, and software updates. Well-structured documentation expedites the onboarding process for new team members, enabling them to swiftly grasp the project's architecture and functionality.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Collaboration</summary>

Documentation fosters collaboration within development teams by establishing a common reference point. It cultivates a shared understanding of the project, its objectives, and the reasoning behind design choices, reducing misunderstandings and fostering efficient teamwork.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sustainability</summary>

Crucially, documentation is a linchpin for the long-term sustainability of a software project. Serving as a valuable resource for future developers, it facilitates seamless transitions between team members and ensures continued development and support, even in the absence of original team members.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Insights</summary>

In the realm of quality assurance, thorough documentation proves invaluable in testing and debugging. It offers insights into anticipated behaviors, potential edge cases, and known issues, streamlining the identification and resolution of bugs and contributing to the overall stability and reliability of the software.
