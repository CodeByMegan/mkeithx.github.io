Welcome and thank you for visiting!

This website is part of my personal project aimed at establishing an intuitive and comprehensive Knowledge Base Portal using various technologies and frameworks to offer valuable and accessible resources for IT developers, helpdesk analysts, and amateur astronomers. More [about me](./me).

## What's Inside?

Discover [docs](/docs/repo) from some of my projects, including [gists](/docs/cheat-sheets) and [tutorials](/docs/guides). Additionally, you'll find articles covering fascinating topics about the universe. Ranging from our very own solar system, facts about celestial mechanics, some influential figures in physics, astronomy, and space exploration, and beyond. [Learn more](../cosmos/).

## Tech Stuff

### Overview

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and relies on [GitHub](https://github.com/login) as its main repository and primary source of truth. My goal is to optimize its development as a single repository (mono-repo), ensuring all code, documentation, and related assets are efficiently managed and easily accessible.

### DevTools

I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to build this website along with helpful plugins and various [open-source resources](/community). While the main configuration may seem intricate, it aims to optimize the framework's performance. Learn [more](/docs/configuration).
