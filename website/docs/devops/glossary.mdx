# Glossary

- **Scrum**: A framework used in agile project management for iterative development of software products.

- **ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)**: A set of best practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of the business.

- **System Administrator (Sysadmin)**: often referred to as a sysadmin, is responsible for managing and maintaining computer systems, servers, and networks within an organization.

<!-- Their duties typically include installing and configuring hardware and software, monitoring system performance, troubleshooting issues, ensuring data security, and performing regular backups. Sysadmins play a critical role in ensuring the reliability, stability, and security of IT infrastructure, enabling smooth operation of organizational systems and services. -->

- **Blockchain**: A decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology used to record transactions across multiple computers in a secure and transparent manner.

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: The network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity, which enables these objects to connect and exchange data.

- **Virtualization**: The process of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, operating system, storage device, or network resources.

- **Machine Learning**: A subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed, typically through the use of algorithms and statistical models.

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. APIs specify how software components should interact.

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: A software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a third-party provider and made available to customers over the internet.

- **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to secure communication or data storage, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

These terminologies cover a wide range of concepts and technologies that are fundamental in the field of Information Technology.
