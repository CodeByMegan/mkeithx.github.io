:::tip[objective]
Proposed enhancements and implement ITIL-Aligned Priority Levels and SLAs for IT Support Requests to current ticketing system.
:::

As an
**IT Support Solution**,

**I want to**
define clear priority levels and enforce associated SLAs for IT support requests,

**so that**
incidents and service requests are resolved efficiently, aligned with their business impact and urgency, and customer satisfaction is maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Urgency
A measure of how long it will be until an Incident, Problem or Change has a significant Impact on the Business.  For example, a High Impact Incident may have low Urgency, if the Impact will not affect the Business until the end of the financial year. 

The following are important factors (derived in probing questions) to better understand the urgency and impact of the issue:

#### History

- ðŸ‘‰ _When did you first notice this problem?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _When was the last time it worked properly?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Have there been any changes made before the issue started?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Is this happening repeatedly?_

#### Troubleshooting & Actions Taken

- ðŸ‘‰ _What have you tried so far to fix the issue?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Did restarting the app or your computer help?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Have you checked if the problem happens on another device or browser?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Have you tried clearing the cache or updating the software?_

#### Impact on Work

- ðŸ‘‰ _How is this affecting your work?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Is it preventing you from completing your tasks or meeting any deadlines?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Can you still do your job, or is it really getting in the way?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Are you using a backup or different tool to keep working?_

#### **Scope of the Issue**

- ðŸ‘‰ _Is anyone else on your team or in your department having the same problem?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Do you know if others in the company are also affected?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Is the issue happening on multiple devices or just yours?_
- ðŸ‘‰ _Is this happening everywhere, or just in one location or network?_


### Priority Levels
Priority is a category used to identify the relative importance of an Incident, Problem or Change.  Priority is based on Impact and Urgency, and it is used to identify the required times for actions to be taken. 

- Priority levels are determined using an Impact-Urgency Matrix: ðŸ”´ Critical (P1), ðŸŸ  High (P2),
ðŸŸ¡ Medium (P3), and ðŸŸ¢ Low (P4).
- Each level has a corresponding response time and resolution time defined in the SLA.

### Standard SLA Structure

By default, all tickets created by email have Low Priority; until that ticket is reviewed by Support Team and the priority is revised as applicable. 

|Priority Level|Initial Response Time|Target Resolution|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|ðŸ”´ (P1)|15 minutes|2 hours|System-wide outages, security breaches, or incidents halting critical business operations.|
|ðŸŸ  (P2)|30 minutes|4 hours|Network disruptions, issues affecting multiple users, or high-priority service requests.|
|ðŸŸ¡ (P3)|1 hour|1 business day|Individual user issues or standard service requests (e.g., software installation).|
|ðŸŸ¢ (P4)|4 hours |3-5 business days|Non-urgent tasks, such as UI fixes or scheduled equipment upgrades.|

### Ticket Classification
Incoming tickets are classified by the assigned technician based on the ff:

| Type  | **Definition** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Incident** | An unplanned interruption to an IT Service | A user cannot log in to their account; Company Portal is Down; D1 is Down
| **Problem** | The underlying or root cause of one or more reported incidents. | Recurring network outages; Frequent app crash |
| **Change Request (CR)** | A request or proposal a change to IT services. | Software upgrades; Third-party software installation; |
| **Service Request (SR)** | Could be a request for information; Standard change, or an access to an IT service. | User onboarding; Specific site access; Password reset; Quarantined Email Release |


## Proposed Enhancements

|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **New**       | Unassigned          | Ticket is not yet assigned to a team member or department for resolution.                                 | P4      |

|               | Awaiting approval   | Approval is required before proceeding (e.g., Change/Service requests).                                   | Hold    |
|               | Need info           | Additional information is needed from the user to proceed.                                               | Hold    |
|               | With Vendor         | Issue is within our scope, but requires vendor involvement (e.g., offshore hardware replacement).         | Hold    |

|               | Vendor/Third Party  | Issue has been resolved by a vendor or third-party service.                                              | N/A     |
| **Closed**    | Notification        | Misrouted or autoresponse email sent, no action required.                                                | N/A     |
|               | Escalated           | Issue is deemed out of scope or escalated for further action.                                            | N/A     |
