# Hello, World! üåèü™ê ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

**Welcome to my digital space!**

This is where I showcase my work, projects, and interests. I also refer to this space as **Keith's Galactic Gazette**, as much of the content here is [intertwined with physics](./cosmos/overview). As I continue to develop, this website serves as my gateway to mastering front-end technologies such as [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Stay tuned for my regular articles as I delve further into this learning journey.
