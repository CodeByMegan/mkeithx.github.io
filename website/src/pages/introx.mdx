<!-- **Welcome to my digital space!** -->

**Thank you for visiting!** This website is where I showcase and share some of my work, projects, including gists and personal interests. It also serves as my gateway to mastering front-end technologies such as [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Beyond technical documentation, I've included fundamental articles about [**physics**](./cosmos/overview), a subject I've been fascinated with perhaps since Genesis. 

Ultimately, get to know more about [**me**](./me) or check out my [**resume**](https://mkeithx.github.io/files/resume.pdf).

I hope you enjoy your visit, and let's get started!
