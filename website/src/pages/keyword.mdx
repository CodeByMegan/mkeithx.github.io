# The Keyword

**Welcome!**

**MKX SpaceHub**â„¢ is a simple documentation website where I showcase some of my work, projects, including gists, and personal interests. It also serves as a milestone towards mastering technical writing and front-end technologies such [**React**](https://react.dev/) and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

<!-- is one of my documentation projects where I share and showcase some of my work, projects, including gists, and personal interests.

Beyond technical documentation, I've included articles about physics, a subject I've been fascinated with perhaps since Genesis. Everything here is a work-in-progress, and as I continue to innovate, so does this website.

Furthermore, my name [**Keith**](./me) by the way and I'd like to thank you for checking in and hope you've enjoyed navigating **MKX SpaceHub**â„¢.
