<b>SpaceHub Project</b>
  </h1>
</div>

This repo contains the configurations and source code powering the **SpaceHub Project** docs [website](https://mkeithx.github.io).

## Overview


The project is part of an internal initiative at [Kitiplex](https://github.com/kitiplex) focusing on standard practices in software development. It emphasizes the importance of providing clear and comprehensive documentation for all projects.


## Configuration
The SpaceHub Project website is a static site generated using the latest [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) version. The `custom` website configuration can be found in [website](/website/docusaurus.config.ts) directory.




Organized as a [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md), this project also includes some [basic code examples](./examples/python-starters/README.md).
