This repo contains the configurations and source code powering the **SpaceHub Project** docs [website](https://mkeithx.github.io).

## Overview

The SpaceHub Project is part of an internal initiative at [Kitiplex](https://github.com/kitiplex) to set standard practices for software development. It focuses on making sure all projects have clear and comprehensive documentation.



## Configuration

The SpaceHub Project website is a static site generated using the latest version of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It is organized as a [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).
