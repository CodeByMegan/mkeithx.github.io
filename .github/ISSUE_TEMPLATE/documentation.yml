        Use this template for documentation requests such as:
        - Documenting APIs
        - Elaborating on topics
        - Updating links

        If documentation issues arise, consider if itâ€™s a documentation or code problem. For code issues, use the "bug" template.

        Pull requests are generally accepted if:
        - Relevant to many users
        - Not about external tooling
        - Not documented elsewhere or hard to find

        You may submit a pull request directly if criteria are met; otherwise, issues are welcome.
