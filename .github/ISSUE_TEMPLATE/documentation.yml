        ## Important!

        Use this template to report various documentation related issue.
        If documentation issues arise, consider if itâ€™s a documentation or code problem. For code issues, use the "bug" template.

        Pull requests are generally accepted if:
        - Relevant to many users
        - Not about external tooling
        - Not documented elsewhere or hard to find

        You may submit a pull request directly if criteria are met; otherwise, issues are welcome.
