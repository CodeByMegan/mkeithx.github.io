        Important things:

        - We expect you to submit a feature request including a real design (API / UI...), not just a basic idea.
        - The design does not have to be perfect, we'll discuss it and fix it if needed.
        - For a more "casual" feature request, consider using Canny instead: https://mkeithx.github.io/feature-requests.
