However, without proper navigation tools, visitors can easily get lost in the sea of information. This is where sitemaps come into play, serving as the digital compass that guides both users and search engine crawlers through the labyrinth of web pages. In this article, we\'ll dive into the world of sitemaps, exploring their importance, types, and best practices.\\n\\n:::tip[Did you know...]\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nA sitemap is a file that lists all the URLs of a website, serving as a roadmap for search engines and users to navigate through its content. Think of it as a blueprint that outlines the structure of a website, making it easier for search engine crawlers to index pages and for users to find relevant information quickly.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Why are Sitemaps Important?\\n\\n1. **Enhanced Crawling Efficiency**: Search engine crawlers use sitemaps to discover and index web pages more efficiently. By providing a comprehensive list of URLs and their priority, frequency of updates, and last modification dates, sitemaps help search engines understand the website\'s structure and prioritize crawling.\\n\\n2. **Improved User Experience**: Sitemaps play a crucial role in enhancing user experience by providing a clear overview of a website\'s content hierarchy. Users can easily find the information they\'re looking for and navigate through different sections of the site without feeling lost or overwhelmed.\\n\\n3. **Facilitated Website Updates**: When a website undergoes changes such as adding new pages, updating content, or changing URLs, sitemaps help notify search engines about these modifications. This ensures that search engines promptly crawl and index the latest version of the website, preventing outdated content from appearing in search results.\\n\\n4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Sitemaps contribute to accessibility compliance by providing a structured overview of website content. This is particularly beneficial for users with disabilities who may rely on assistive technologies to navigate the web.\\n\\n## Types of Sitemaps\\n\\n1. **XML Sitemaps**: XML sitemaps are the most common type used for search engine optimization (SEO). They are machine-readable files that list URLs along with additional metadata such as last modification date, priority, and frequency of change.\\n\\n2. **HTML Sitemaps**: HTML sitemaps are designed for human visitors and typically displayed as a webpage containing a hierarchical list of links to different sections of the website. While not as crucial for SEO purposes, HTML sitemaps can improve user experience and accessibility.\\n\\n3. **Image and Video Sitemaps**: In addition to textual content, websites may contain multimedia assets such as images and videos. Image and video sitemaps provide search engines with metadata about these media files, helping improve their visibility in image and video search results.\\n\\n## Best Practices for Sitemaps\\n\\n1. **Keep it Updated**: Regularly update your sitemap to reflect any changes to your website\'s structure or content. This ensures that search engines have access to the latest information.\\n\\n2. **Include All Relevant URLs**: Make sure your sitemap includes all the important pages of your website, including subdomains and alternate language versions if applicable.\\n\\n3. **Follow XML Sitemap Guidelines**: Adhere to the guidelines provided by search engines such as [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/10/best-practices-for-xml-sitemaps-rssatom) and [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/webmaster-guidelines-30fba23a) for creating XML sitemaps. This includes limiting the number of URLs per sitemap, specifying canonical URLs, and ensuring proper formatting.\\n\\n4. **Submit to Search Engines**: Once you\'ve created your sitemap, submit it to search engines using their respective webmaster tools. This notifies search engines of the existence of your sitemap and encourages them to crawl and index your website more efficiently.\\n\\n:::tip[Conclusion]\\n\\n:::\\n\\nSitemaps play a crucial role in optimizing website visibility, enhancing user experience, and facilitating efficient crawling and indexing by search engines. By implementing sitemaps following best practices, website owners can ensure that their digital properties are effectively navigable and discoverable on the vast landscape of the internet."},{"id":"/api-vs-config","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/api-vs-config","source":"@site/blog/2024/03-17-api-vs-config.mdx","title":"APIs & Configurations","description":"Understanding APIs and Configurations","date":"2024-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"api","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"label":"configs","permalink":"/blog/tags/configs"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/blog/tags/software"},{"label":"development","permalink":"/blog/tags/development"}],"readingTime":2.25,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Keith Tan","title":"Author","url":"https://mkeithx.github.io/me","twitter":"mkeithtan","github":"mkeithX","email":"email@kitimi.onmicrosoft.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/mkeithx.png","key":"mkeithx"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"APIs & Configurations","sidebar_label":"APIs & Configurations","description":"Understanding APIs and Configurations","slug":"/api-vs-config","authors":["mkeithx"],"image":"https://imgur.com/OH3qWLN.png","tags":["api","configs","software","development"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"About Sitemaps","permalink":"/blog/about-sitemaps"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"import Tabs from \'@theme/Tabs\';\\nimport TabItem from \'@theme/TabItem\';\\n\\n\x3c!-- ## Overview --\x3e\\n\\nHello there! Let\'s explore the difference between APIs and configurations and how they can streamline your projects. Whether you\'re new to development or experienced, understanding these concepts can help you enhance your project\'s functionality and customization options.\\n\\n![img](https://imgur.com/OH3qWLN.png)\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\n## Understanding APIs:\\n\\nLet\'s start with APIs. An API, or Application Programming Interface, acts as a bridge between different software applications, allowing them to communicate. In simple terms, APIs enable your project to interact with external services or data sources. For example, you might use an API to retrieve weather forecasts or integrate with social media platforms.\\n\\n### Example API\\n\\n\\n\x3c!-- <details>\\n  <summary>OpenAI API Integration</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>Python</div>\\n    <br/>\\n\\n```py\\nimport openai\\n\\n\\n# Set your OpenAI API key\\nopenai.api_key = \'your-api-key\'\\n\\n\\n# Call the OpenAI API to generate text\\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\\n  engine=\\"text-davinci-002\\",\\n  prompt=\\"Once upon a time,\\",\\n  max_tokens=50\\n)\\n\\n# Print the generated text\\nprint(response.choices[0].text.strip())\\n```\\n  </div>\\n</details> --\x3e\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>OpenAI API</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>Python</div>\\n    <br/>\\n\\n```py\\nimport os\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\n\\nclient = OpenAI(\\n    api_key=os.environ.get(\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\"),\\n)\\n\\nGPT_MODEL = \\"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\\"\\n\\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\\n    model = GPT_MODEL,\\n    response_format={\\"type\\": \\"text\\"},\\n    messages=[\\n        {\\"role\\": \\"system\\", \\"content\\": \\"You are a helpful assistant, skilled in explaining complex programming concepts in simple terms.\\"},\\n        {\\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": \\"Explain the difference of class and function based views in python.\\"}\\n    ]\\n)\\n\\nprint(completion.choices[0].message.content)\\n```\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n## Understanding Configurations\\n\\n\\nNow, let\'s talk about configurations. Configurations, or configs, are settings that define how your project behaves and looks. They let you customize aspects like colors, layouts, and domain names without diving into complex code. Configurations make it easy to tailor your project to your preferences and needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Example Configuration\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Docusaurus Configuration </summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>docusaurus.config.js</div>\\n    <br/>\\n\\n```js\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  title: \'My Docusaurus Site\',\\n  tagline: \'A website for showcasing my projects\',\\n\\n  url: \'https://example.com\',\\n  baseUrl: \'/\',\\n\\n  projectName: \'my-docusaurus-site\',\\n  organizationName: \'my-org\',\\n\\n  themeConfig: {\\n    navbar: {\\n      title: \'My Site\',\\n      logo: {\\n        alt: \'My Site Logo\',\\n        src: \'img/logo.svg\',\\n      },\\n      items: [\\n        {\\n          href: \'https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus\',\\n          label: \'GitHub\',\\n          position: \'right\',\\n        },\\n      ],\\n    },\\n    footer: {\\n      style: \'dark\',\\n      links: [\\n        {\\n          title: \'Docs\',\\n          items: [\\n            {\\n              label: \'Getting Started\',\\n              to: \'/docs/intro\',\\n            },\\n            {\\n              label: \'Guides\',\\n              to: \'/docs/installation\',\\n            },\\n          ],\\n        },\\n        {\\n          title: \'Community\',\\n          items: [\\n            {\\n              label: \'Stack Overflow\',\\n              href: \'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus\',\\n            },\\n            {\\n              label: \'Discord\',\\n              href: \'https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus\',\\n            },\\n          ],\\n        },\\n        {\\n          title: \'More\',\\n          items: [\\n            {\\n              label: \'GitHub\',\\n              href: \'https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus\',\\n            },\\n          ],\\n        },\\n      ],\\n    },\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThese examples demonstrate how to integrate the OpenAI API into a Python script to generate text and how to configure a Docusaurus project using its configuration file (docusaurus.config.js). You can adapt and use these examples in your own projects as needed.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\n_\u2014 K_"},{"id":"/welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2024/03-10-welcome.mdx","title":"Welcome","description":"Exploring some of my Work, Projects, and Stuff","date":"2024-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":1.49,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Keith Tan","title":"Author","url":"https://mkeithx.github.io/me","twitter":"mkeithtan","github":"mkeithX","email":"email@kitimi.onmicrosoft.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/mkeithx.png","key":"mkeithx"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome","slug":"/welcome","authors":["mkeithx"],"tags":["hello","welcome"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"APIs & Configurations","permalink":"/blog/api-vs-config"}},"content":"## Exploring some of my Work, Projects, and Stuff\\n\\nWelcome to my website!
