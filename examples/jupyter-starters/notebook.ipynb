    "## What is Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports various programming languages, but it's most commonly used with Python due to its extensive libraries for data manipulation and analysis. [Learn more](https://jupyter.org/).\n",

    "### Why Use Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Interactive Computing**: With Jupyter Notebooks, you can write and execute code in small chunks called cells. This interactive computing environment allows you to experiment with code and see the results immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Data Exploration**: Jupyter Notebooks are great for exploring data. You can import datasets, visualize them, perform analysis, and share your findings‚Äîall within the same document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Collaboration**: Whether you're working on a project with a team or sharing your work with others, Jupyter Notebooks make collaboration easy. You can share your notebooks via email, GitHub, or the Jupyter Notebook Viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Education**: Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in education for teaching programming, data science, and other subjects. They provide an interactive and engaging way for students to learn and experiment with code.\n",
